Agile Artificial Intelligence is a book that covers classical algorithms commonly assimilated as artificial intelligence techniques. The book series takes a practical approach by presenting implementation details.

Agile Artificial Intelligence uses the Pharo programming language to illustrates the numerous concept explained in the book. We believe the book is written is such a way that non-expert with Pharo will enjoy its content. Translation to other programming language should not be an issue.

Publishing a book involves some legal aspects that need to be carefully considered. We thank Fernanda Carvajal Gezan and Rosa Leal, from the University of Chile.

# What do our readers think about the book?

_"One of the best technical books I have read. Even in its current evolving form it is the simplest presentation of a complex subject. Words or review cannot do justice to the way it is presented. I would be recommending this to everyone, I can to read and download Pharo specially the interface with Keras, which I followed on in another thread.  The concepts of perceptron, neuron and neural networks cannot be simplified any further in words or code. It is the combination of the presentation of the material and Pharo Smalltalk, that will resonate for the artists in programming world._

_It will kick off my journey for AI on Pharo, now onwards. Hope I pick up enough and am able to contribute in any manner to completion of the book and sooner we see the additional chapters coming through the better it is._

_Thanks for the book, the code framework, the contribution is immense for Smalltalkers for sure, probably for many students too, if they pick up AI on this foundation first and move on if they have to on other platforms for career reasons."_ **Sudhakar Krishnamachari**, 2018

_"the Book so far is great, I am looking forward to more"_ **mldavis99**, 2018

_"This is cool. [...] I think one of the real advantages of the book is that you can very easily generate visualizations that better describe what's actually happening than just some mathematical symbolic formula. It's a good strategy"_ **darth-cheney**, 2018
